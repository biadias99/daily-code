# 🧠 daily-code

Repository with the main goal of training data structures and algorithms.

## 📅 Goal

Practice every day to improve my skills in:

- Problem-solving logic
- Data structures
- Algorithmic thinking
- Technical interview preparation

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Main language: `JavaScript`
- Editor: VS Code

## 📁 Structure

- Divided into folders related to the main topic of the problem and also by difficulty levels (`easy`, `medium`, and `hard`).

I'm trying to find a way to stay consistent and more active in these topics — and maybe one day, others can use this repository to help them in their own learning journey too.
